        Calculates class-aware metrics using prototype similarities and class identities.

        This function was created to calculate metrics that require multiple forward passes through backbone. None currently implemented.

        Args:
            target (torch.Tensor): The target class labels for the batch.
            model: A ProtoPNet model instance that contains prototype_class_identity
                  and get_prototype_class_identity method.
            similarity_score_to_each_prototype (torch.Tensor): Similarity scores between
                input images and each prototype. Batch x Prototypes.

        Returns:
            Dict[str, torch.Tensor]: A dictionary containing:
                - prototype_class_identity: A one-hot encoded matrix of shape (num_prototypes, num_classes)
                  where each row represents a prototype and each column represents a class.

                - prototypes_of_correct_class: A binary tensor of shape (batch_size, num_prototypes)
                  where 1 indicates that a prototype belongs to the same class as the target
                  label for that batch item. For example, if batch item i has target class c,
                  then prototypes_of_correct_class[i,j] = 1 if prototype j belongs to class c.

                - prototypes_of_wrong_class: A binary tensor of shape (batch_size, num_prototypes)
                  that is the complement of prototypes_of_correct_class. A value of 1 indicates
                  that a prototype belongs to a different class than the target label for that
                  batch item.

                - incorrect_class_prototype_activations: A tensor of shape (batch_size,) containing
                  the highest similarity score achieved by any prototype belonging to an incorrect
                  class for each batch item. This can be used to measure how strongly an input
                  activates prototypes from classes other than its target class.
